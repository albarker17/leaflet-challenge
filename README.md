# leaflet-challenge
Module 15 Challenge

In this challenge, I created a tool for The United States Geological Survey that will allow them visualize their earthquake data in a more meaningful way. This tool will allow them to better educate the public and other government organizations on issues facing our planet.

First, I gathered the data from the USGS and used the URL to pull in the data for the visualization.
Next, using Leaflet I created a map that plots all of the earthquakes from my dataset based on their longitude and latitude. The data markers reflect the magnitude of the earthquake by their size and depthof the earthquake by color. For example, earthquakes with higher magnitudes appear larger and earthquakes with greater depth appear darker in color (see legend). 

I have also included popups that provide additional information about the earthquake when it's associated marker is clicked.
